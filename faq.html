          statcheck is a "spellchecker" for statistics. It checks whether your 
          <i>p</i>-values match their accompanying test statistic and degrees 
          of freedom.

  		    statcheck searches for null-hypothesis significance test (NHST) in APA
  		    style (e.g., t(28) = 2.2, p < .05). It recalculates the <i>p</i>-value
  		    using the reported test statistic and degrees of freedom. If the
  		    reported and computed <i>p</i>-values don't match, statcheck will flag 
  		    the result as an error.

          statcheck recognizes correlations and t, F, &chi;&sup2;, Z tests and 
          Q tests, as long as they are reported completely (test statistic,

          By default, statcheck treats all tests as two-tailed. If you want to 
          take into account one-tailed tests, you can check the box "Correct for 
          one-tailed tests".

      	<p>
      	  When this box is ticked, statcheck will search the entire text for 
      	  the keywords "one-tailed", "one-sided", and "directional" (taking 
      	  spacing issues etc. into account). When statcheck finds at least one 
      	  of those keywords AND an initially inconsistent result would be 
      	  consistent if it was a one-tailed test, then statcheck treats this 
      	  case as a one-tailed test and counts it as consistent.

          Some common reasons why statcheck doesn't detect some results:
        </p>
        <ol>
        	<li>
        		The result was not reported according to APA style. This includes 
        		minor deviations such as square brackets instead of parentheses, or 
        		a semi-colon instead of a comma.
        	</li>
        	<li>
        		The result was not reported completely. statcheck needs three 
        		ingredients to detect a result and recalculate the <i>p</i>-value: 
        		the reported test statistic, degrees of freedom, and <i>p</i>-value. 
        		If one or more of these are missing, statcheck will not pick it up.
        	</li>
        	<li>
        		The result is reported in a table.

          statcheck flags result as an error when the 
          reported <i>p</i>-value does not match the recalculated 
          <i>p</i>-value. However, there may be cases in which you deliberately 
          reported an inconsistent result. For example:
        </p>
        <ol>
          <li>
            You conducted a one-tailed test, but you did not explicitly state 
            it was a one-tailed test using one of the keywords mentioned above.
          </li>
          <li>
            You used a Bonferroni correction on your <i>p</i>-value (i.e., 
            multiplied your <i>p</i>-value by the number of tests) to correct 
            for multiple testing.
          </li>
          <li>
            You corrected the degrees of freedom for a violation of an 
            assumption (e.g., sphericity), but reported the unadjusted test 
            statistic and <i>p</i>-value.
          </li>
        </ol>
        <p>
          Of course it is also possible that statcheck really made a mistake 
          and erroneously flagged a result as inconsistent. If you think that 
          statcheck wrongly flagged one of your results, please contact Mich√®le 
          (see below).

          In typical psychology journals, statcheck detects about 60% of the 
          null hypothesis significance tests. In classifying extracted results 
          as consistent or inconsistent, statcheck has an accuracy between 
          96.2% and 99.9%, depending on its settings. See 
          <a href="https://psyarxiv.com/tcxaj/"> Nuijten et al., 2017</a>: for
