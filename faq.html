<button class="FAQ-collapsible ms-font-l">What is <i>statcheck</i>?</button>
<div class="FAQ-content ms-font-m">
  	<p>
  		<i>statcheck</i> is a "spellchecker" for statistics. It checks whether your 
  		<i>p</i>-values match their accompanying test statistic and degrees of freedom.
  	</p>
</div>

<button class="FAQ-collapsible ms-font-l">How does it work?</button>
<div class="FAQ-content">
  	<p>
  		<i>statcheck</i> works in roughly 3 steps:
  	</p>

  	<ol>
		<li>
			<b>Search for statistics</b><br> It scans the text for null-hypothesis 
			significance test (NHST) results that are reported 1) completely (test 
			statistic, degrees of freedom, and <i>p</i>-value), and 2) in APA style.
		</li>
		<li>
			<b>Recalculate <i>p</i>-value</b><br> Using the reported test statistic and 
			degrees of freedom, <i>statcheck</i> recalculates the <i>p</i>-value. By 
			default, the recalculated <i>p</i>-value is two-sided.
		</li>
		<li>
			<b>Flag inconsistencies</b><br> <i>statcheck</i> compares the reported 
			<i>p</i>-value with the recomputed <i>p</i>-value. If these two don't 
			match, <i>statcheck</i> will flag the result as an error.
		</li>
	</ol>

	<p>For example, say that you reported the following result:</p> 

	<p><i>The difference was significant, <i>t</i>(28) = 1.2, <i>p</i> < .05.</i></p>

	<p>If you click "Run <i>statcheck</i>", <i>statcheck</i> will recognize this as a 
		statistical test. It will take the degrees of freedom (28) and test 
		statistic (2.2) and recalculate the <i>p</i>-value: <i>p</i> = .24. This <i>p</i>-value 
		does not match the reported <i>p</i>-value, so <i>statcheck</i> will flag this result 
		as an error.</p>
</div>

<button class="FAQ-collapsible ms-font-l">How do I correct the inconsistency?</button>
<div class="FAQ-content">
	<p>If you click on a result that <i>statcheck</i> flagged as an error, you can see 
		the recalculated <i>p</i>-value. Click on "Go to test" to jump to the location of 
		the test in your document. </p>

	<p>To fix any errors, go to your statistical software to check which of the 
		three numbers (test statistic, degrees of freedom, and/or <i>p</i>-value) you 
		need to correct.</p>
</div>

<button class="FAQ-collapsible ms-font-l">Which results does <i>statcheck</i> detect?</button>
<div class="FAQ-content">
  
  	<p><i>statcheck</i> searches for specific patterns and recognizes statistical 
  	  	results from correlations and t, F, &chi;&sup2;, Z tests and Q tests. 
  	  	<i>statcheck</i> can only read these results if the results are reported exactly 
  	  	according to the APA guidelines:</p>

  	<ul>
	<li>t(df) = value, p = value</li>
	<li>F(df1, df2) = value, p = value</li>
	<li>r(df) = value, p = value</li>
	<li>&chi;&sup2; (df, N = value) = value, p = value (N is optional, &Delta;G 
		is also included, since it follows a &chi;&sup2; distribution)</li>
	<li>Z = value, p = value </li>
	<li>Q (df) = value, p = value (<i>statcheck</i> can read and distinguishes between 
		Q, Qw / Q-within, and Qb / Q-between)</li>
	</ul>

	<p><i>statcheck</i> takes into account that test statistics and p values may be 
		exactly (=) or inexactly (< or >) reported. Different spacing has also been 
		taken into account.</p>
</div>

<button class="FAQ-collapsible ms-font-l">What does the correction for one-tailed tests do?</button>
<div class="FAQ-content">
  
  	<p>By default, <i>statcheck</i> treats all tests as two-tailed. If you want to take 
  	  	into account one-tailed tests, you can check the box "Try to correct for 
  	  	one-tailed tests?". </p>

	<p>When this box is ticked, <i>statcheck</i> will search the entire text for the 
		keywords "one-tailed", "one-sided", and "directional" (taking spacing 
		issues etc. into account). When statcheck finds at least one of those 
		keywords AND an initially inconsistent result would be consistent if it was 
		a one-tailed test, then statcheck treats this case as a one-tailed test and 
		counts it as consistent.</p>

	<p>Note that this correction for one-tailed tests only works if the one-tailed 
		tests are explicitly identified as such in the text, with one of the 
		keywords mentioned above.</p>
  
</div>

<button class="FAQ-collapsible ms-font-l">Why doesn't <i>statcheck</i> detect my statistics?</button>
<div class="FAQ-content">
  <p>Some common reasons why <i>statcheck</i> doesn't detect some results:</p>

  <ol>
	<li>
		the result was not reported according to APA style. This includes minor 
		deviations such as square brackets instead of parentheses, or a 
		semi-colon instead of a comma.
	</li>
	<li>
		the result was not reported completely. <i>statcheck</i> needs three 
		ingredients to detect a result and recalculate the <i>p</i>-value: the 
		reported test statistic, degrees of freedom, and <i>p</i>-value. If one or 
		more of these are missing, <i>statcheck</i> will not pick it up.
	</li>
	<li>
		the result is reported in a table.
	</li>
  </ol>
</div>

<button class="FAQ-collapsible ms-font-l">Why does <i>statcheck</i> say it's an error when I think it's not?</button>
<div class="FAQ-content">
  <p>As a general rule: <i>statcheck</i> flags result as an error when the reported <i>p</i>-value does not match the recalculated <i>p</i>-value. However, there may be cases in which you deliberately reported an inconsistent result. For example:</p>

  <ol>
<li>you conducted a one-tailed test, but you did not explicitly state it was a one-tailed test using one of the keywords mentioned above</li>
<li>you used a Bonferroni correction on your <i>p</i>-value (i.e., multiplied your <i>p</i>-value by the number of tests) to correct for multiple testing</li>
<li>you corrected the degrees of freedom for a violation of an assumption (e.g., sphericity), but reported the unadjusted test statistic and <i>p</i>-value</li>
</ol>

<p>In all these cases, the reported <i>p</i>-value does not match the accompanying test statistic and degrees of freedom anymore, and causes statcheck to flag the result as a potential error.</p>

<p>We would like to argue that in these cases, there is no reason to report a result as internally inconsistent. We would advise the following in the  scenarios above, respectively:</p>

<ol>
<li>explicitly identify which tests are one-tailed and which are two-tailed. This will increase the transparency and reproducibility of your text.</li>
<li>when using a Bonferroni correction, correct your <i>alpha level</i> by dividing it by the number of tests, instead of multiplying the <i>p</i>-value. The latter results in internal inconsistencies, but could also result in impossible <i>p</i>-values larger than 1.</li>
<li>when adjusting results for violations of assumptions, report the entire adjusted result, instead of only adjusting one element in the result (i.e., only the test statistic, degrees of freedom, or the <i>p</i>-value).</li>
</ol>

<p>Of course it is also possible that <i>statcheck</i> really made a mistake and erroneously flagged a result as inconsistent. This can happen when <i>statcheck</i> does not correctly read and/or classify the test type of the extracted statistic. For more information about <i>statcheck</i>'s accuracy, see the next section.</p>
</div>

<button class="FAQ-collapsible ms-font-l">How accurate is <i>statcheck</i>?</button>
<div class="FAQ-content">
  <p>
  	In typical psychology journals, <i>statcheck</i> detects about 60% of the null hypothesis significance tests. In classifying extracted results as consistent or inconsistent, <i>statcheck</i> has an accuracy between 96.2% and 99.9%, depending on its settings. See <a href="https://psyarxiv.com/tcxaj/"> Nuijten et al., 2017</a>: for details.
